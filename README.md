## Notes

While building this app, I encountered a few challenges:

* Handling data persistence: Implementing a robust data storage mechanism to ensure that notes are saved and retrieved reliably.
* Navigation and fragment management: Managing the navigation flow between the list of notes and the note editing screen can be complex.
* User interface design: Designing an intuitive and visually appealing user interface to enhance the user experience.
